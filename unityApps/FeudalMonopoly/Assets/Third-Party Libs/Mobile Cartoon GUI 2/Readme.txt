=== For All Users ===

Please import your DFGUI or NGUI plugin ahead of this package.

There are some duplicated sprites in some atlases. They are there for swapping between color themes w/out breaking existing UIs.

If you have questions or need support, please contact us via gcassets@gmail.com.


=== For NGUI Users ===

The example scene is suppose to run under 960px * 640px resolution, change it in Player Settings when switched to Desktop or Web Player platforms.

"Pixel Size" in example atlases are set to 0.6 to adapt regular desktop screens. 

Set atlas “Pixel Size” to 1 if you want to use it for high DDI display(retina display for example).


=== For DFGUI Users ===

If you are using DFGUI and don’t have NGUI plugin in your project, do not import “NGUI Example Scene.unitypackage”, or it will report missing script errors.
